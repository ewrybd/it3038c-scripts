# CALCULATOR

======

### Welcome to my calculator

======

This is an improvement to the simple calculator that I did for Project 1. All you need to do is download the script and run it in Python. The goal of this script is to be a calculator that can be used for a variety of operations. I have now added exponents to the script, modulus (finding remainder), and have now made the script allow for up to 6 numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is very simple to use, and I plan to continue adding to this script when I learn even more.

##### I have used my previous code and added onto it. I did not use any outside resources to complete this task.

```python
Uses a while loop and user input to complete arithmetic calculations.
