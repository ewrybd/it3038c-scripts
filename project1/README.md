# SIMPLE CALCULATOR

======

### Welcome to my calculator

======

This app will work as a simple calculator in Python. Download the script and give execute permissions to run it. Then enter the operator, and two numbers to be calculated. The program will output the result, or indicate if the operator selected was invalid.

##### I have taken a java programming course as well, so I am going to use my prior knowledge to assist with this task.
