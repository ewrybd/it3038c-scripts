# CALCULATOR

======

### Welcome to my calculator

======

This is an improvement to the simple calculator that I did for Project 1 + 2. All you need to do is download the script and run it in Python. The goal of this script is to be a calculator that can be used for a variety of operations. I have now commented the code as well as completely restructured the code. Now the calculator will allow you to input as many integers as you want, with a prompt to ask if finished. On top of actually restructuring all of my previous code, I have added floor division to the code as well. Now the script contains all of the operators that Python has available, and allows for infinite input to the operators.

##### I have used my previous code and added onto it. I did not use any outside resources to complete this task.

```python
Uses a while loop and user input to complete arithmetic calculations.
